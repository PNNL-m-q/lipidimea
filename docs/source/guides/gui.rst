GUI
==============================
GUI application is available for configuring, running, and viewing results from 
DDA-DIA lipidomics analysis workflow


Technical Overview
------------------------------
The graphical user interface (GUI) was built in JavaScript utilizing the Electron framework and Node.js. This allows for cross-platform compatibility including Windows, macOS, and Linux from a single code base. Security standards were 
implemented primarily through the use of context isolation and preload features. This application was packaged and made distributable with electron-builder. The backend, designed in Python, was integrated via PyInstaller for each platform. 
All in all, this application efficiently runs LipidIMEA, reads the SQLite output database, and displays the results through Highcharts.
