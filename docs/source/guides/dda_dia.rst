DDA-DIA Data Analysis
==============================
Analysis workflow for DDA-DIA data.


Parameters
------------------------------
Due to the large number of parameters that go into the complex DDA-DIA data analysis, parameters are stored
in a structured YAML file. These parameter files contain two top-level sections: input/output and parameters. 
The input/output section stores the lists of input DDA and DIA data files, as well as the filename of the lipid 
IDs database in which the analysis results will be stored. The parameters section contains all of the actual
analysis parameters, organized heirarchically according to the different individual DDA and DIA data analysis
steps.
